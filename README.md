# Go-

This is the iOS version of the app. The Android version will soon follow once this version is complete.

I initially came up with this idea for people who are unemployed or looking to make extra money on the side. 
The basic idea is this:

Pay your friends or people nearby to do something for you.
Get paid by your friends or people nearby to do something for them.

The app works like this:

A new user will login with their facebook account and be asked a few onboarding questions for ID verification. From there,
it will transition to the home screen

The home screen will show a table of all current listings in your area. The listings can be filtered to everyone, friends,
by distance, and minimum amount. In the future I will add a feature that filters by keywords and hashtags.

While scrolling through the table, you will see the name, description and amount someone is willing to pay for a service. 
These can range anywhere from, rides, grocery pick ups, chores, errands, waiting in line for something etc.. 

If I am interested in doing the job, I just have to click the request button and the user who posted the listing 
will be notified.

The user that posted the listing can view all their current and active listings, view requests, profiles and reviews
to make a decision on who they would like to hire for the job. Once it's decided, the apple pay button can be pressed
and the amount is withdrawn and placed in the platform account.

The user who requests a job can view all their requests and approved jobs on a side menu where they can exchange messages,
get map information, upload pictures and videos of receipts and other relevant information about the job for disputes. Once
the job is complete, a click of a button will transfer the funds from the platform account into that users account less applicable fees. The original poster will have the opportunity to review the person hired or dispute the claim.

Each user will have a profile that can be accessed from another side menu. It has the name, photo and brief bio. 
They will also have a star rating and reviews submitted from their history.

Other items in the side menu will include the history of all completed jobs/posts and user settings.

As this project is currently in development, not all the features are live yet and some bugs may be present. I try to work on
this as much as I can while holding down a full time job. 

However, as of the time of this writing, the app is able to create posts, view posts, and with facebook test users, can create
multiple listings to test the request/approval process and pay out completed jobs. There's also a basic profile that allows 
users to friend each other.

Future updates will be posted here as they come.

Thanks
